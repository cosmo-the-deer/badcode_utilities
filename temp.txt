Increase the version number in your setup.py:

    version='0.1.2'  # or higher, must be unique and not used before

Delete old build files to avoid confusion:

    rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info

Rebuild your package:

    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

Upload again:

    twine upload dist/*


✅ How to Add MkDocs Docs to Your GitHub Repo
We'll assume your repo is already cloned locally (or you can do it now):


git clone https://github.com/cosmo-the-deer/badcode_utilities.git
cd badcode_utilities
🧱 Step 1: Create the Docs Folder
From the root of your project:


mkdocs new .
This will create:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
badcode_utilities/
├── docs/
│   └── index.md
└── mkdocs.yml
You can also create docs/functions.md and other files manually.

✍️ Step 2: Add Markdown Docs
Example file: docs/functions.md

markdown
Copy
Edit
# Function Documentation

## `random_string(length: int) -> str`
Generates a random string of the specified length using ASCII letters.

## `encrypt_text(text: str, key: str) -> str`
Encrypts the text using a simple XOR cipher with the provided key.
Then update mkdocs.yml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
site_name: badcode_utilities
theme:
  name: material
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Functions: functions.md
📦 Step 3: Commit Docs to Your Repo
bash
Copy
Edit
git add docs mkdocs.yml
git commit -m "Add MkDocs documentation"
git push
🚀 Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages
From your project root:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdocs gh-deploy
This will:

Build the static site

Push to a gh-pages branch

Automatically configure GitHub Pages

Go to your repo on GitHub:

Settings → Pages → Set Source to gh-pages branch (if it isn't already)

Your site will be at:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://cosmo-the-deer.github.io/badcode_utilities/
⚠️ Note
If you haven’t already, install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
And make sure gh or GitHub CLI is authenticated (or push manually to GitHub if needed).

Want me to generate an initial functions.md for your existing code automatically? Just say the word.

Perfect — since you're on Linux, everything works just as well (if not better). Here’s a Linux-optimized summary and a few clarifications:

✅ Quick Linux Setup Summary
1. 🧰 Install MkDocs and Material Theme
If you use pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
Or if you're using a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
2. 📁 In Your Project Root
Navigate to your cloned repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/path/to/badcode_utilities
Then initialize MkDocs:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdocs new .
Edit your files in the generated docs/ folder. Create functions.md, etc.

3. 🧪 Test Docs Locally
From the repo directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdocs serve
Then open your browser to:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:8000
4. 🌍 Deploy to GitHub Pages
From the same project folder, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdocs gh-deploy
This will:

Build the site into /site

Push it to the gh-pages branch

Enable GitHub Pages automatically

🧠 Helpful Linux Tips
Make sure git is installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install git
If mkdocs gh-deploy gives GitHub auth issues, try:

bash
Copy
Edit
git config --global credential.helper store
If you're not using GitHub CLI, make sure your SSH key is added (or use HTTPS with a token).

Would you like me to:

Generate the initial Markdown (functions.md) based on your existing code?

Or give you a custom mkdocs.yml layout based on your folder structure?

Just say the word.
